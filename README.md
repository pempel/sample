# Sample

A simple Rails application with a basic login system from scratch.

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rspec` or `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. And finally, run `bin/rails s` to start the application. You can also run `bin/rails c` for an interactive rails console that will allow you to experiment.
